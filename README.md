# Deep-Latent-Variable-Models-for-Text-Generation-and-Summarization

These are my implementations of [OPTIMUS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04092) and [CARA](https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6346/6202) both published by Microsoft.

The results and detailed explanations for these models can be found in my report
